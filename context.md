# Project Context: AI-Powered Restaurant Recommendation System (Zomato Use Case)

## Overview

Build an AI-powered restaurant recommendation service inspired by Zomato. The system intelligently suggests restaurants based on user preferences by combining structured data with a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Objective

Design and implement an application that:

- Takes user preferences (such as location, budget, cuisine, and ratings)
- Uses a real-world dataset of restaurants
- Leverages an LLM to generate personalized, human-like recommendations
- Displays clear and useful results to the user

## System Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion

- Load and preprocess the Zomato dataset from Hugging Face: [ManikaSaini/zomato-restaurant-recommendation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ManikaSaini/zomato-restaurant-recommendation)
- Extract relevant fields such as restaurant name, location, cuisine, cost, rating, etc.

### 2. User Input

Collect user preferences:

| Preference | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Location | Delhi, Bangalore |
| Budget | low, medium, high |
| Cuisine | Italian, Chinese |
| Minimum rating | numeric threshold |
| Additional preferences | family-friendly, quick service |

### 3. Integration Layer

- Filter and prepare relevant restaurant data based on user input
- Pass structured results into an LLM prompt
- Design a prompt that helps the LLM reason and rank options

### 4. Recommendation Engine

Use the LLM to:

- Rank restaurants
- Provide explanations (why each recommendation fits)
- Optionally summarize choices

### 5. Output Display

Present top recommendations in a user-friendly format:

- Restaurant Name
- Cuisine
- Rating
- Estimated Cost
- AI-generated explanation

## Key Technical Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| Dataset | Zomato restaurant data from Hugging Face |
| Filtering | Match restaurants to user preferences before LLM processing |
| LLM | Reasoning, ranking, and natural-language explanations |
| UI / Output | Clear presentation of top recommendations with metadata |

## Data Source

- **Dataset URL:** https://huggingface.co/datasets/ManikaSaini/zomato-restaurant-recommendation
- **Relevant fields:** restaurant name, location, cuisine, cost, rating, and related metadata

## Success Criteria

1. Users can specify location, budget, cuisine, minimum rating, and optional preferences.
2. The system filters the dataset based on those inputs.
3. An LLM ranks and explains recommendations using the filtered structured data.
4. Results are displayed with name, cuisine, rating, estimated cost, and an AI-generated explanation.
